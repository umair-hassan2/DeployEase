# DeployEase

DeployEase is a tool that makes it easy to deploy React.js websites. It uses microservices, message brokers, and scalable infrastructure to let you deploy your site with just one click.

## Key Features

- **Microservice Architecture**: Scales and handles faults easily with a flexible design.
- **RabbitMQ Integration**: Uses RabbitMQ to manage messages between uploading and deployment for more reliable operations.
- **Cloudflare R2 Object Storage**: Provides scalable storage for your files with Cloudflare R2.
- **GitHub Integration**: Deploys from public GitHub repositories with ease.

## Future Plans

- **Auto Redeployment**: I plan to add auto redeployment when your repository changes.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: I want to add detailed logging to help with troubleshooting.
- **Containerization**: I aim to use containers for better security and portability.
